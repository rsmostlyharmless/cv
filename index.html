                Hi I'm Ryan, a lover of coffee, playstation and anything that allows me to explore
                and experience new things in life. Learning new skills has always been a favourite
                activity for me as it helps me evolve further as a person and explore new work
                ventures. Some of the work titles I have been apart of in the past have been very
                different but have had 3 things in common, problem solving, client facing and being
                hands on. All these qualities I take great pride in and use them regularly in all
                aspects of life.
